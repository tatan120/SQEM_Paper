# Optimum fiscal equalization and welfare in Chile


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This repository is the official implementation of the paper "Optimum fiscal equalization and welfare in Chile".

### Abstract:
We optimize the horizontal fiscal equalization and compute the welfare gain for Chile. We find that national welfare would increase between 3\%-12\% if the property tax base were broadened. An optimal design would also reduce the inequality in municipal population distribution by 7\% and productivity by 6\%. Our results provide insights into how to promote spatial equity without negatively impacting aggregate welfare and productivity.
