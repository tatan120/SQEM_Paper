# Optimum fiscal equalization and welfare in Chile


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This repository is the official implementation of the paper "Optimum fiscal equalization and welfare in Chile".

### Abstract:
We optimize the horizontal fiscal equalization and compute the welfare gain for Chile. We find that national welfare would increase between 3\%-12\% if the property tax base were broadened. An optimal design would also reduce the inequality in municipal population distribution by 7\% and productivity by 6\%. Our results provide insights into how to promote spatial equity without negatively impacting aggregate welfare and productivity.

## Built With

The Spatial Equilibrium Model is fully developed in Python 3 and requires the following modules.

* Numpy.
* Pandas.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and replicate the results of the paper follow these steps.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tatan120/SQEM_Paper
   ```
2. Execute the file `master.py`, located in the `Core codes` folder of the colned repository. 
3. The result files should appear in your core codes folder.


<!-- RESULTS -->
## Counterfactual description

The results of the code includes welfare variation counterfactuals simulations for the following scenarios:

* $\delta_1$ progressive variation from $1%$ to $100%$.
* $\delta_2$ progressive variation from $62%%$ to $100%$ for the four wealthiest cities (Vitacura, Las Condes, Providencia, Santiago).
* $\delta_2$ progressive variation from $0%%$ to $50%$ for for all municipalities, including those that do not contribute anything.
* $\delta_3$ progressive variation from $0%$ to $100%$.

in each scenario the ratio $\displaystyle \frac{W_{CF}-W_0}{W_0}$ is computed to explore the effect of each intervention.
